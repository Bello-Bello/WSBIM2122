## Introduction


Learning objectives:

- Learn what the shell is and why it is important for bioinformatics.
- Learn how to work with files and navigate directories.
- Learn how run shell scipts.



### What is a shell and why should I care? {-}

A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with
a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell:

- Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line
  interface, or have extra capabilities in the command line version
  that are not available in the GUI. This is true, for example, of
  [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), which offers many
  advanced functions only accessible to users who know how to use a
  shell.
- In bioinformatics you often need to do the same set of tasks with a
  large number of files. Learning the shell will allow you to automate
  those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting
  things.
- The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same
  thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they’re likely
  to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand
  times with no mistakes.
- The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your
  work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a
  record of every step that you’ve carried out, which you can use to
  re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to
  communicate unambiguously what you’ve done, so that others can check
  your work or apply your process to new data.
- Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power
  and can’t realistically be run on your own machine. These tasks are
  best performed using powerfull remote computers or cloud computing,
  which can only be accessed through a shell.

In this lesson you will learn how to use the command line interface to
move around in your file system.

### How to access the shell {-}

On a Mac or LiOn a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell
through a program called Terminal, which is already available on your
computer. If you’re using Windows, you’ll need to download a separate
program to access the shell.nux machine, you can access a shell
through a program called Terminal, which is already available on your
computer. If you’re using Windows, you can install a [Windows
Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). We
are going to the use RStudio Terminal.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rstudio_terminal.png")
```

At any point, you can use the `clear` command or the `Ctrl+L` keyboard
shortcut to clear the screen.


### The Shell {-}

The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell,
it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling
software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only
one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne
Again SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by
Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern
implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like
tools for Windows.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```
$
```

The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but may use a different
symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt as $
. Most importantly: when typing commands, either from these lessons or
from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that
follow it.

So let’s try our first command, `ls` which is short for listing. This
command will list the contents of the current directory:

```
$ ls
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

If the shell can’t find a program whose name is the command you typed,
it will print an error message such as:

```
$ ks
ks: command not found
```

This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program
corresponding to that command is not installed.

## Navigating Files and Directories

Questions

- How can I perform operations on files outside of my working directory?
- What are some navigational shortcuts I can use to make my work more efficient?

Objectives

- Use a single command to navigate multiple steps in your directory
  structure, including moving backwards (one level up).
- Perform operations on files in directories outside your working directory.
- Work with hidden directories and hidden files.
- Interconvert between absolute and relative paths.
- Employ navigational shortcuts to move around your file system.



Let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which
stands for “print working directory”). At any moment, our current
working directory is our current default directory, i.e., the
directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in, unless
we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer’s response is
/home/dcuser, which is the top level directory within our cloud
system:

```
$ pwd
/home/lgatto
```

To create a shared set of files and directories, we will use the
`rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()` function in RStudio's R console:

```{r rm_shell_data, echo = FALSE}
unlink("shell_data", recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare_shell_data}
rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Using the `ls` shell command in the Terminal, verify that you have a
new directory called `shell_data`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Let’s say we want to navigate to the `shell_data` directory we saw
above. We can use the `cd` command (*change directory*) to get there:

```
$ cd shell_data
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

What files and/or directories can you find in the `shell_data`
directory? You can make the `ls` output more comprehensible by using
the flag `-F`, which tells ls to add a trailing `/` to the names of
directories.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

```
$ man ls
```

`man` (short for manual) displays detailed documentation (also
referred as man page or man file) for `bash` commands. It is a
powerful resource to explore bash commands, understand their usage and
flags. Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the
file using your keyboard’s down arrow or use the `Space` key to go
forward one page and the `b` key to go backwards one page. When you
are done reading, hit `q` to quit.

An alternative to access the manual page (and sometimes, depending on
the environment, only one is available) is the pass `--help` to the
command:

```
$ ls --help
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Use the `-l` option for the ls command to display more information for
each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional
information this long format gives you that you don’t see with the
bare ls command?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


### Shortcut: Tab Completion {-}

Typing out file or directory names can waste a lot of time and it’s
easy to make typing mistakes. Instead we can use tab complete as a
shortcut. When you start typing out the name of a directory or file,
then hit the `Tab` key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the
directory or file name.

Return to your home directory:

```
$ cd
```

then enter:

```
$ cd she<tab>
```

The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for
`shell_data`.

Tab completion isn't limited to `cd`; it works with any shell command.

Using tab completion will save you a lot of typos and time!

```
$ cd shell_date
cd: shell_date: No such file or directory
```

### Hidden files and directories

Files and directories that start with a `.` are hidden, i.e that they
won't show up with `ls`. To display *all* files and directories,
including the hidden ones, you can use the `-a` flag.

```
$ ls -a
```

You can combine multiple flags in two ways:

```
$ ls -F -a
$ ls -Fa
```

In addition to these hidden files, such as `.bash_profile`, you will
also two hidden directories, namely `.` and `..`. `.` refers to the
current directory (the one shown by `pwd`) and `..` refers to the
parent directory.

We have seen how we can use `cd shell_data` to move into
`shell_data`. To move back out of `shell_data`, you can use:

```
$ cd ..
```

The shell interprets the character `~` (tilde) at the start of a path
to mean *the current user's home directory*.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Navitage to the `shell_data` directory. From there, list the files
  and direcoties in it's parent directory.

- Using a single command, list the files and directries in your home
  directory. Make sure this command will work from anywhere on your
  system.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


## Working with Files and Directories

To create a directory, you can use the `mkdir` command, short for
*make directory*:

```
$ mkdir my_dir
```

To create (empty) files, use the `touch` command:

```
$ touch my_file.txt
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Make sure you are in the `shell_data` directory and create a new one
called `wsbim2122_notes` and, in that directory, 3 files respectively
called `shell_notes.txt`, `report.Rmd` and `omics.md`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Note that the files created above contain a **file name*
(`shell_notes`, `report`, `omics`) and the **file extension** (`txt`,
`Rmd` and `md`)! You can of course create a file without extension,
but you (and the computer) won't know what type of file it is from its
name.

The tips about variable naming that we saw in previous years also hold
for file names. Complicated names of files and directories can make
your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a
few useful tips for the names of your files.

1. Don't use spaces. Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since
   spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is
   better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use
   `-` or `_` instead.
2. Don’t begin the name with `-` (dash). Commands treat names starting
   with - as options.

3. Stick with letters, numbers, . (period or ‘full stop’), - (dash)
   and _ (underscore).

Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. There
are special characters that can cause your command to not work as
expected and can even result in data loss.

If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes
("").

### Viewing files {-}

To view a file, you can use `cat` to display the whole file at
once. This might work for the file that you just edited (try it out),
but not for any of the files in the `shell_data/data` directory.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Navigate to the `shell_data/data` directory.
- View the content of one of the files starting with `seq`.
- Use either of `head` or `tail` to view the few first and last lines
  of that fils.
- How many first and last lines to you see? Read the `head` manual
  page to view the 20 first/last lines.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`cat` is a terrific program, but when the file is really big, it can
be annoying to use. The program, `less`, is useful for this
case. `less` opens the file as read only, and lets you navigate
through it. The navigation commands are identical to the man program:

- use `b` to go backward
- use `g` to go to the beginning
- use `G` to go to the end
- use `q` to quit

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

View any of the `seq` using `less`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`less` also gives you a way of searching through files. Use the `/`
key to begin a search. Enter the word you would like to search for and
press enter. The screen will jump to the next location where that word
is found.

**Shortcut**: If you hit `/` then `enter`, less will repeat the
previous search. less searches from the current location and works its
way forward. Scroll up a couple lines on your terminal to verify you
are at the beginning of the file. Note, if you are at the end of the
file and search for the sequence `CAA`, less will not find it. You
either need to go to the beginning of the file (by typing g) and
search again using `/` or you can use `?` to search backwards in the
same way you used `/` previously.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Search for the sequence `TATATA` in your file.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

### Using a text editor in the shell? {-}

For this course, given that we are using RStudio, you will be able to
view and edit your files with it directly. However, this won't be
possible if you use the terminal outside of RStudio, such as when you
connect to a server.

There exist several text-based editors, i.e. editors that can be used
in the shell without a dedicated graphical user interface. Here, we
will use `nano` for its simplicity.

Open one of the files that you just created with

```
$ nano shell_notes.txt
```

Let's type in a few lines of text. Once we’re happy with our text, we
can press `Ctrl+O` (press the `Ctrl` or `Control` key and, while
holding it down, press the `O` key) to write our data to disk (we’ll
be asked what file we want to save this to: press `Return` to accept
the suggested default).

Once our file is saved, we can use `Ctrl+X` to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

### Creating, moving, copying, and removing {-}

Make sure you are inside the `shell_data/data` directory and create
two new directories, namely `fas` and `sim`.

To copy the `seq_1.fas` file into the `fas`:

```
$ cp seq_1.fas fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Verify that the file now also exists in the `fas` directory.
- Copy the `sim_1.csv` file into the `sim` directory and check that it
  worked.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


To move the `seq_2.fas` file into the `fas`:

```
$ mv seq_2.fas fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Verify that the file now also exists in the `fas` directory only.
- Move the `sim_2.csv` file into the `sim` directory and check that it
  worked.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

We now have two copies of the `seq_1.fas` and `sim_1.csv` files. The
`rm` command can be used to delete them, either one by one

```
$ rm seq_1.fas
$ rm sim_1.fas
```

or in one go

```
$ rm seq_1.fas sim_1.fas
```

We can use wildcards for accessing or manipulate multiple files at
once. For instance, to move all `fas` files to the `seq` directory, we
can:

```
$ mv seq*.fas seq
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. Copy all the `csv` files into the `sim` directory.
2. Delete all `csv` files in the `data` directory.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Reproduce the following folder structure

```
shell_data/new_dir
shell_data/new_dir/file1.txt
shell_data/new_dir/file2.txt
shell_data/new_dir/data/seq_1.fas
shell_data/new_dir/data/sim_100.fas
```

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`
