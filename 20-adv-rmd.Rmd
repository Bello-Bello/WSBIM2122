# R markdown {#sec:rmd}

We have already seen how to implement [reproducible
report](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM1207/sec-rr.html) using
the
[Rmarkdown](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM1207/sec-rr.html#knitr-and-rmarkdown)
[package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in the WSBIM1207 cours.


Here, we are going to see a few additional capabilities


## Knitting from within R

There will be cases when the `Knit` button in RStudio will not be
available. A typical example

- `rmarkdown::render`
- caching
- slides
- references
