# Enrichment analyses {#sec:gsea}


Motivation

- What are the next steps after a DE analysis?
- Why are enrichment analyses useful?
- Understanding an over-enrichment analysis.
- Understanding a gene set enrichment analysis.
- Application of the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("clusterProfiler")` package.

## Introduction

1. DE is univariate - each gene is tested on its own. This probably
   doesn't reflect biology - genes expression work in conjunction, not
   in isolation. One wouldn't expect that the effect of a drug, or a
   mutation, ... would lead to the perturbation of a single gene
   expression.

2. The univariate approach expects (tests for) significant changes
   (especially concidering adjustment for multiple testing). Moderate
   effects in many (related) genes wouldn't be identified as
   statistically significant, even it such an effect my be
   biologically more plausible that one of a few large ones.

3. The goal of an enrichment analysis is to test for a group of
   related genes, called gene sets, and test whether the genes within
   these set are enriched for differential expression.


## Gene sets

How do we define gene sets?

GO, KEGG, ReactomeDB, MySigDB.

## Statistical analyses

How to test for enrichment? (1) over-enrichment analysis (ORA) and (2)
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
